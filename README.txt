Graph Plotter++

An improvement to Syed Mehroz Alam's Expression Plotter demo [http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/20567/Expression-Plotter-Control].

Features a root finder using FLEE (Fast Lightweight Expression Evaluator - https://flee.codeplex.com/] and some three algorithms [Bisection, False Position, Secant] for approximating the roots.

Done as a school project. :D

TODO
> Extending FLEE to Expression Plotter Control
> Unified GUI
